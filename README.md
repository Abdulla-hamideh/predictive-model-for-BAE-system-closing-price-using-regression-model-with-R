# predictive-model-for-BAE-system-closing-stock-price-using-a-regression-model
data derived from yahoo finance closing price from 2015 to 2018

# Objectives 
trying to build a model to predict BAE system closing stock price vs the actual price for 2019-2020

# What the code includes 
assessing the correlation for top 5 companies that correlate with BAE System then building a simple regression model of 5 independent variables this is the first model 

the second and final model starts with: 

the process is using  variable selection methods and transformation then creating a regression model (automatic selection and non automatic)
the final model is in the prediction file code however in the project file code the final model variable was only after the variable selection more modification happens in the prediction code such as removing some variables due to multicollinearity and more transformation happened in that file  
the final model contained 11 independent variables
