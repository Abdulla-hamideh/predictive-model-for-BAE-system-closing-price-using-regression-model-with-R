# predictive-model-for-BAE-system-closing-stock-price-using-a-regression-model
trying to predict BAE system closing stock price vs the actual price 
the process is using  variable selection methods and transformation then creating a regression model 
the final model is in the prediction file code however in the project file code the final model variable was only after the variable selelction more modification happens in the prediction code such as removing some variables due to multicollinearity and more transformation happened in that file
